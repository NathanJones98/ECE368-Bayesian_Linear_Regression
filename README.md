# ECE368-Bayesian_Linear_Regression
Bayesian linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between input variables and output variables. Bayesian linear regression incorporates prior knowledge about the parameters of the model into the analysis, allowing for uncertainty estimation and robust inference; prior distributions are specified for the regression coefficients, and these distributions are updated based on observed data to obtain posterior distributions.
